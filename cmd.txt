angular is full of @Component - this needs to be imported first import {Component } from '@angular/core'
	a componenet has 3 items
		selector - html tag 
		templateUrl - html file path
		styleUrls - css file faths - in array notation

all ts files should contain export - so here componenet ts file can have export class AppComponent { other values to export }

[(ngModel)]="name" -- to be import first to use in module.ts @NgModule - main file		 using @angular/forms - FormsModule - two way data binding

bootstrap3 -- add under angular.json -> architect - build - styles

ng generate will create new componenet with the class implements OnInit - ngOnInit


main fies -- index.html --> main.ts --> app.module.ts (@ngModule decorator) --> then componenet


DataBinding 
	String Interpolation {{}} -- for data binding
	Property Biding [property] = "data" --html element property value change
	Event Binding - user reaction - btn click - (event) = expression
	two way data binding - [(ngModel)] = "data"

Directives 
	@Directive decorator - for custom directive
	angular core Directives
	 	structural changing directive
			ngIf -- *ngIf -- * must to say,; 
			*ngIf - else , ng-template #tag
		attribute changing directive
			ngStyle - attribute / property changes- not the structural or DOM 
			[ngStyle] -- since property changes - surround with  []
			[ngStyle] = {} --> value should be key value pair with {}
			[ngClass] = same as ngStyle
			seems , ngStyle can be used within ngClass


The way we added it, the Navbar will collapse on smaller screens. Since we didn't implement a Hamburger menu, that means that there's no way of accessing our links on smaller screens.

You can either add such a menu on your own, or you replace collapse navbar-collapse  with just navbar-default
